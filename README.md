# Learning

Hi to everybody!
I want to change my life because there weren't any new in it for a long time (same job for 20 years). 
That's why I've got lots of plans about learning Data Science and improve my skills in Data analysis.
What I want to learn:
1. Python
2. R
3. Statistics
4. Machine Learning

My repository will be my collection of knowledges
